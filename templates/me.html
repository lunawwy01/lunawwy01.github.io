        Hi there! I am Lunaüëãüèª
    </p>
    <p>
        I started studying computer science quite late. I never expected myself to do anything involved in coding until
        I took COMM 205 in the summer term of my first year. It is a required course about Excel and RStudio for my BCOM
        degree. Surprisingly, I ended up finding that coding is quite interesting, and I decided to switch to the BUCS program
        after my second year. I am happy that I enjoyed all the CPSC courses I took. I built some interesting
        projects, went to my first hackathon with my friends, and now working on this personal website :)
    </p>
    <p>
        I took my first year online because of COVID. During my entire first year, I didn't go to any school activities
        or join any clubs. Maybe that is because all the events are online or the 15 hours time differences. I know
        these sound like excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I came to campus in my second year, I started getting involved in lots of campus activities and programs.
        I have worked as a teaching assistant, research assistant, club IT coordinator, cultural ambassador, and even
        went for a Summer Abroad Program at UC Berkeley in the past 2 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am working as an Agile Developer Co-op at SAP from May to December, and I am continuously working as
        a part-time research assistant at UBC, focusing on generative AI. I am also learning Japanese in a language exchange
        program in UBC XD
    </p>
