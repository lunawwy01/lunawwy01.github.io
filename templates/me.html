        Hi there! I am Lunaüëãüèª
    </p>
    <p>
        I started studying computer science quite late. I never expected myself to do anything involved in coding until
        I took COMM 205 in the summer term of my first year. It is a required course about Excel and RStudio for my BCOM
        degree. Surprisingly, I ended up finding that coding is quite interesting, and I decided to switch to the BUCS program
        after my second year at Sauder. I am happy that I enjoyed all the CPSC courses I took last year. I built some class
        projects, went to my first hackathon with my friends, and now working on this personal website :)
    </p>
    <p>
        I took my first year online because of COVID. During my entire first year, I didn't go to any school activities
        or join any clubs. Maybe that is because all the events are online or the 15 hours time differences. I know
        these sounds like excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I came on campus last year, I started getting involved in lots of campus activities and programs.
        I participated in the Summer Abroad Program and studied Digital Archive Design at UC Berkeley. I am also in
        the UBC Sauder School of Business Commerce Scholars Program with my mentor Dr. Mi Zhou and plan to focus my
        research on machine learning and data visualization. I also worked for both the Commerce Undergraduate Society
        and the Computer Science Student Society. Moreover, I volunteered in the Vancouver Summer Program as a cultural
        ambassador, helping 60 Sauder summer exchange students to explore UBC and Vancouver in general. Next term,
        I will be in the UBC CPSC Tri-mentoring program as a mentee, working with an industry mentor and a junior student.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding my next step, I plan to apply for the science co-op this fall and launch my first co-op term next year.
        I hope I can get my first research assistant job with my mentor Dr. Mi Zhou in the following winter term. Besides,
        I really want to learn more about photography!
    </p>
