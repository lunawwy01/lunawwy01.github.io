        Hi there! I am Lunaüëãüèª
    </p>
    <p>
        I started studying computer science quite late. I never expected myself to do anything involved in coding until
        I took COMM 205 in the summer term of my first year. It is a required course about Excel and RStudio for my BCOM
        degree. Surprisingly, I ended up finding that coding is quite interesting, and I decided to switch to the BUCS program
        after my second year. I am happy that I enjoyed all the CPSC courses I took. I built some interesting
        projects, went to my first hackathon with my friends, and now working on this personal website :)
    </p>
    <p>
        I took my first year online because of COVID. When I came to campus in my second year, I started getting involved in lots of campus activities and programs.
        I have worked as a teaching assistant, research assistant, club IT coordinator, cultural ambassador, went for a
        Summer Abroad Program at UC Berkeley, and just finished my intern at SAP Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am studying full-time at UBC, and working as a part-time TA for CPSC 121 Models of Computation. In my free time,
        I like playing Lego, and I am also learning Japanese in a language exchange program at UBC
        XD
    </p>
